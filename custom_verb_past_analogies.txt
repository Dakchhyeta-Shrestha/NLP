build built grow grew
teach taught catch caught
send sent lend lent
spend spent bend bent
choose chose freeze froze
speak spoke break broke
write wrote ride rode
drive drove rise rose
wear wore tear tore
throw threw blow blew
find found grind ground
bind bound wind wound
sink sank drink drank
ring rang sing sang
begin began swim swam
run ran come came
be was have had
do did make made
take took give gave
see saw get got
think thought bring brought
buy bought fight fought
teach taught seek sought
sell sold tell told
feel felt keep kept
leave left sleep slept
stand stood understand understood
lose lost mean meant
meet met read read
pay paid say said
hear heard hold held
lead led feed fed
shoot shot sit sat
dig dug stick stuck
strike struck hang hung
spin spun sting stung
weep wept creep crept
deal dealt dream dreamt
burn burnt learn learnt
smell smelt spoil spoilt
forgive forgave forget forgot
forbid forbade forgive forgiven
choose chose eat ate
fall fell fly flew
grow grew know knew
lie lay shake shook
steal stole swear swore
tear tore wake woke
wear wore win won
withdraw withdrew write wrote
arise arose awake awoke
bear bore beat beat
become became bend bent
bet bet bite bit
bleed bled breed bred
broadcast broadcast build built
cast cast cling clung
cost cost cut cut
draw drew fling flung
freeze froze kneel knelt
lay laid leap leapt
light lit melt melted
quit quit read read
sweep swept swing swung
thrust thrust weep wept
